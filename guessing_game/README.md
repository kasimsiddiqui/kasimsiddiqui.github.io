I have created a game that prompts the user to guess my age and stores it as a variable called guess. I am 26 years old. It has a stored value called answer to represent my age. The next part of my code is an if/else statement that compares guess to answer. If guess is equal to answer then the user is told that they made the correct guess. If their guess is too high they are alerted that such and same for if their guess is too low.

We added a variable called "wrong" and included an if statement that would refresh the page once the user guessed correctly.

Converted game to work within an object with a constructor and method and all of that stuff.

Removed prompts and alerts and now I have DOM and text box
