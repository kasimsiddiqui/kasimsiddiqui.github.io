# Drink-Locale
CF Project Week

**PROJECT SCOPE**: An app that suggests local beers to users through the following channels:

- random suggestion by picking a style (IPA, Lager, Pale, ESB, Brown, Belgian)
- suggests new beers similar to what they’ve ‘drank’ (give me something similar in style, abv, or brewery)
- stores previously imbibed & previously suggested beers
- ‘advanced’ search page

**Interactivity**:
- User selects type of beer and random result from data is returned.
- Want something similar to something user has already tried, if not already tried - returns related type, brewery, etc.
- Age verification (Yes/No)
- Generic Search
- “Drink it” - user clicks if they’ve had it. Records each time they’ve had it. Tracking all recommendations, whether or not they’ve already had it. CSS Style will show whether it has been enjoyed or not yet.

**EXTENSION #1**:
- MOOD BREWS. Suggestions based on how you are “feeling” - snarky vibe. If Morning, shower beer…If pissed at work, high ABV, if “sophisticated -fancy beer

**HTML5**
- Use Dialog boxes for age verification, beer suggestions (similar to pop-ups)
- One content box to rule them all
- CSS controls backgrounds from page to page
- NO DIVS. Semantic HTML :)

**SOURCES**:
- Brewery DB: http://www.brewerydb.com/developers/docs-endpoint/brewery_beer
- We are working with local breweries and local beers. Nothing beyond that with our initial project scope.


**Potential extensions**:
- Login w/ facebook.
- Connect to real backend.
- Integrate “Share” buttons.
- Other locations outside seattle (‘select location’ pulls correct beer info from API)
