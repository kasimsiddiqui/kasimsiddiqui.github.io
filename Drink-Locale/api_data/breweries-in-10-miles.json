Elysian left this partnership in 2002 upon expiration of the five-year contract. A short year later Elysian opened TangleTown, an 80-seat neighborhood brewery\/bistro.

The most recent addition to the Elysian empire, Elysian Fields, opened in August 2006. Perched next to Seattle\u2019s two sports arenas, Fields seats 400 and packs the house at lunch and on gamedays.

We set sail in December 2009, during the height of a global economic storm, and have quickly become one of the fastest growing breweries in Washington, with our beer is now sacking and pillaging cities throughout Washington and British Columbia. We have taken a different tack than many new brewers, and rather than going for a number of very big, single batch beers, we are focused on food-friendly beers in a smaller lineup that is readily available year round. We realized a long time ago that food-friendly by no means needs to be less flavorful, and we actually add ingredients to widen the palate of our beers above and beyond their original styles.\r\n\r\nTo better integrate with a meal and make our beers more \u2018sessionable\u2019 in general, we utilize highly attenuating yeasts to dry out our beers to make them less sweet and filling, then replace that desired sweetness with an addition outside the norm, such as Juniper, Ginger or even Angelica. These ingredients are always kept at a level to avoid building a \u2018spice beer\u2019, and always present themselves as a unique and complementary addition. We also focus on extremely clean finishes, and use the entire recipe to build bittering rather than just using the hops to reduce lingering starchiness.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the true beauty of any flavor is in the eye (and mouth) of the beholder. Read about our beers here, then taste them at your local restaurant or store and judge for yourself if we have truly crafted \u2018Great Beer Designed With Great Food In Mind\u2019.

We will strive to be a gathering place for beer lovers and support bicycling as a great way to get around our beautiful city.\r\n\r\nPeddler Brewing Company has a 7-barrel brewing system which means it can pump out up to 14 kegs of beer per batch. We plan to have 8 taps in our tap room with a few regular taps and a couple rotating seasonal taps. We also plan to have a guest tap or two of other WA state brews or ciders. Our indoor space will have a large bar and tables for guests to sit back and enjoy a taster tray or a pint. We will also have a growler and 32oz bottle exchange to take beer home, with a small deposit encouraging the return and re-use of bottles\/growlers.\r\n\r\nDecide to ride your bike to our brewery? Perfect! We have an indoor bike rack that holds 9 bicycles and will have a bike work station for you to do some tune-ups, pump up your tire, or easily fix that flat.

Instead of having a few flagship beers available at all times, we release two new beers each month. These are only around while they last and then will be supplanted by the next styles in line. You can think about it as brewing only *seasonals* such as a stout or a winter warmer in the winter, a nice malty brown in the fall, or a refreshing kolsch or hefeweizen in the summer.

One was an engineer toiling away on the super computers of a local university, and the other was a supervisor managing the complex operations of a local billionaire. Both of them loved their jobs, but more than their jobs they loved beer. Each Don had a recurring dream of a magical place without a name, a place where the great beers of the world flowed like the Salmon le Sac at flood stage, and the fine brewing tradition of the Pacific Northwest stood proudly beside the best concoctions from far-flung breweries in Asia and across Europe.\r\n\r\nDon and Donald worked tirelessly in the wee hours on their home brew mixtures, searching for the best possible combination of hops, malt, barley, and love. For long years, the two Dons had their separate dreams, and never met. A local poet named Bryan had the pleasure of growing up with Donald, and worked for the same local billionaire as Don. After many months of hearing Don speak of his dream of the magical beer haven, Bryan knew it must be the very same place of which Donald had spoken too. He knew instinctively that it was his responsibility to bring the two Dons together. On a fateful summer afternoon at the Elysian Brewery on Capitol Hill, the two Dons met. The event later became known as THE HAPPY HOUR OF DESTINY.\r\n\r\nEvery patron in the pub knew something special was happening that day. The magical place both men dreamed of was one and the same. That very afternoon, the two Dons vowed to create a great beer haven right here on earth, and together they would name this magic place THE NAKED CITY. In THE NAKED CITY, it doesn't matter where you're going or where you've been, all that matters is great living and great beer. In THE NAKED CITY, the only problem is what great craft beer to try next. The two Dons spent a combined 25 years studying the world's great brewing traditions, and couldn't wait to begin experimenting together. Their very first batch of beer, an Oak-aged double IPA, took a ribbon in the Northwest regionals of the 2007 National Homebrew Competition. The rest, as they say, is history.\r\n\r\nTwo years after the two Dons combined their separate dreams, THE NAKED CITY opened its doors. Now Naked City boasts an award-winning brewery that produces a variety of small-batch beers available at the pub and friendly bars and restaurants in Seattle, Tacoma, Bellingham, and beyond. The 24 taps of THE NAKED CITY offer a constantly rotating variety of Washington's best beers, regional craft beers, and the best beers Donald and Don have found in two lifetimes of beer travels around the world.\r\n\r\nTwo and a half years after THE NAKED CITY was founded, the Dons convinced the local poet who brought them together to join them in the adventure. The Dons and Bryan together built a bigger brewery; a full-size kitchen; a dining room\/movie theatre called The Screening Room that features free monthly events including film, comedy, poetry, community discusssion, and jazz; and now The Walrus Beer Garden, a patio that's home to murals by local artists, games, and summertime events.\r\n\r\nSo. Welcome to THE NAKED CITY, where great beer lovers flock like the salmon of Capistrano, and the only question is: WHAT TAP NEXT?","website":"http:\/\/www.nakedcitybrewing.com\/","established":"2008","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WF34ng\/upload_s2ninP-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WF34ng\/upload_s2ninP-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/WF34ng\/upload_s2ninP-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:03","updateDate":"2014-09-18 11:14:39"},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"distance":5.8},{"id":"NXRM7y","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"8570 Greenwood Ave. North","locality":"Seattle","region":"Washington","postalCode":"98103","phone":"(206) 428-7709","latitude":47.6921041,"longitude":-122.3549951,"isPrimary":"Y","inPlanning":"N","isClosed":"N","openToPublic":"Y","locationType":"micro","locationTypeDisplay":"Micro Brewery","countryIsoCode":"US","status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-08 14:48:19","updateDate":"2015-06-08 14:48:19","breweryId":"QB5Njg","brewery":{"id":"QB5Njg","name":"Flying Bike Cooperative Brewery","description":"Washington's first cooperative brewery, featuring Member Driven Beer.","website":"http:\/\/flyingbike.coop","established":"2010","isOrganic":"N","images":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QB5Njg\/upload_EDRYRc-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QB5Njg\/upload_EDRYRc-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/brewery\/QB5Njg\/upload_EDRYRc-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-05 22:31:05","updateDate":"2015-06-08 14:47:06"},"country":{"isoCode":"US","name":"UNITED STATES","displayName":"United States","isoThree":"USA","numberCode":840,"createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"distance":5.8},{"id":"ejzxPj","name":"Main Brewery","streetAddress":"309 S.

We set sail in December 2009, during the height of a global economic storm, and have quickly become one of the fastest growing breweries in Washington, with our beer is now sacking and pillaging cities throughout Washington and British Columbia. We have taken a different tack than many new brewers, and rather than going for a number of very big, single batch beers, we are focused on food-friendly beers in a smaller lineup that is readily available year round. We realized a long time ago that food-friendly by no means needs to be less flavorful, and we actually add ingredients to widen the palate of our beers above and beyond their original styles.\r\n\r\nTo better integrate with a meal and make our beers more \u2018sessionable\u2019 in general, we utilize highly attenuating yeasts to dry out our beers to make them less sweet and filling, then replace that desired sweetness with an addition outside the norm, such as Juniper, Ginger or even Angelica. These ingredients are always kept at a level to avoid building a \u2018spice beer\u2019, and always present themselves as a unique and complementary addition. We also focus on extremely clean finishes, and use the entire recipe to build bittering rather than just using the hops to reduce lingering starchiness.\r\n\r\nIn the end, the true beauty of any flavor is in the eye (and mouth) of the beholder. Read about our beers here, then taste them at your local restaurant or store and judge for yourself if we have truly crafted \u2018Great Beer Designed With Great Food In Mind\u2019.

After that trip, the direction of the brewery was set. German beer had to be re-discovered by the population. After many discussions on opening a brewery and a trip to Germany, the dream became reality. We found an existing brewery to purchase - Lunar Brewing. After purchasing Lunar and getting approved for all the necessary licensing, Baron is ready to go. On June 14th, the world of Seattle will have the chance to finally taste and purchase Baron Beer. The first style of many to be released is our flagship beer - Munich Lager.That is all for the history.

Except, it wasn't a garage in someone's house but rather in Jeremy's business. With concrete floors and roll up doors, it was the perfect place to brew beer\u2014and no spouses would be ticked that their kitchen or home was getting trashed in the process. The reason for wanting to \"home\" brew? Because the Friday beer parties at his business were starting to rack up some serious expenses. After all, we wanted to drink the good stuff and 22oz. bombers ain't cheap. So, Jeremy got the crazy idea (as he often does) to figure out a way to make beer so that we didn't have to spend so much money on other people's beer. \r\n\r\nThe problem was\u2026where to start? Jeremy knew he wanted to brew beer but the reality was that with so many home brewers out there\u2014each with their own opinion on how to do things\u2014it was going to be a challenge to corral and sift through the information he needed to get started and actually brew good beer. \r\n\r\nAfter a few \"test\" batches that yielded sub-standard beer, he got serious and started researching and researching and doing even more research until that first \"golden\" batch came through. Eventually, the challenge went from brewing good beer to brewing good beer consistently. Again, with more research, he figured it out. Then, he got the idea. \"What about other new or rookie home brewers out there? Aren't they facing the same problems I am? Wouldn't they and new home brewers want a convenient location to get it hands-on information about brewing?\" At that moment, Geaux went from a hobby to a serious endeavor to bring professional-level brewing techniques to the home brewing community. Then, the REAL fun began.\r\n\r\nGoing from a \"home\" brewing operation to a commercial brewery (which is required if you plan to brew anywhere outside of home\u2026even if you don't sell it (oops.)) was a bit more than anyone ever envisioned.
